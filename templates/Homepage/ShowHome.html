    <strong><h2> About Us</h2></strong><br>
    <p>
        <strong>Artisans club</strong> is a online art gallery. As we are facing this COVID pandemic situation, we decided to create
        a website for the people who loves art.<br><br>
        Here users can see artworks submit by other users as well as they can submit their own artwork. People have to sign-up so that
        they can visit our website. We have different blog regarding artistic things. Users can also post blogs written by them.
        We will arrange competitions depend on the occasions. Users can participate on these competitions by submitting their artworks.
